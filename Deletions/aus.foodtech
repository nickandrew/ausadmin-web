Newsgroup: aus.foodtech
Planned-deletion-date: 1998-05-01
Reason: No independent discussion going on, only crosspost and spam

This is one of the groups which Phil had targeted for deletion but
never got around to it. There are some postings which appear to be
crossposted from other "food" type groups but no independent discussion.
The group also seems to pick up a lot of spam. Hasta La Newsgroupa, baby...
