Checkgroups message for aus.*
-----------------------------

(Last update: 6/12/95 - added aus.test)

1. What's a checkgroups message?
   -----------------------------

A checkgroups message is a control message like a newgroup or an
rmgroup; it helps you administer your active and newsgroups files.
Specifically, it supplies a definitive list of the newsgroups that you
should be carrying.

A checkgroups that lists all the currently valid groups in the aus.*
namespace is posted every other week to every site in the aus
distribution. By the time you read this, that message will have
arrived at your site. *This* message is just a listing of the
newsgroups in that control message.


2. What happens when my site receives a checkgroups message?
   ---------------------------------------------------------

That depends on your software, and how it's configured. The default
behaviour for INN is to mail a list to your news adminsitrator,
showing which groups are to be added, and which are to be removed. The
list is in a form that can be fed directly into sh to perform the
changes.

It is also possible to configure your news software to do the changes
immediately, if it has been sent from a specific email address. By
default, INN is configured to respond to checkgroups message from
Robert Elz <kre@munnari.OZ.AU>. (However, he seldom sends checkgroups
messages these days, which is a problem!)


3. What if I want to synch my active and newsgroups files right away?
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

If required, you can apply this checkgroups as follows: remove
everything below here, then feed it into sh while logged on as 'news'.
You may have to change the path shown.
