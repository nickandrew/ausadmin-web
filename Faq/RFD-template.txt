should be raised and resolved.  The discussion period will continue
for a minimum of 21 days (starting from when the first RFD for this
proposal is posted to aus.net.news), after which a Call For
Votes (CFV) may be posted by the aus.* administration team (See
http://aus.news-admin.org/ for further information).  Please do not
attempt to vote until this happens.

All discussion of this proposal should be posted to aus.net.news.

This RFD attempts to comply fully with the Usenet newsgroup creation
guidelines outlined at http://aus.news-admin.org/Faq/aus_faq.  Please
refer to that document (available in news.announce.newgroups) if you
have any questions about the process.
