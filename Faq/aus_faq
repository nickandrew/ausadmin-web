Creating a new newsgroup in the aus hierarchy
---------------------------------------------

Last update: February, 1996; added URL. Expect major changes
to this document soon, as the aus.* newsgroups are showing
increasing signs of poor propagation.



This (unofficial) document describes a set of guidelines for 
people who wish to create a new newsgroup within the aus 
hierarchy. Since no organisation oversees this process, this 
document can't be regarded as a set of "rules" or even 
"policies", so whether you adhere to these guidelines is up 
to you. However, bad karma may accrue if you don't.

(Procedures exist for creating new newsgroups in other 
hierarchies. The rules for creating new newsgroups in all 
other hierarchies except alt are particularly detailed, and 
can be found in regular postings in the newsgroup 
news.announce.newusers. The alt hierarchy has no official 
rules, but guidelines appear regularly in news.answers.)


1. Picking a name
   --------------

This really is amazingly important. A badly chosen name can 
arouse an astonishing amount of ire in other news users. A 
really bad name can cause software failures. To avoid 
annoying too many people, here are some suggestions:

	Try to be consistent with existing newsgroup names.
	Use nouns where possible.
	Always stick to letters and numbers.
	Letters should be lower case.
	Don't use dots as word separators, as they are used to 
		delimit sub-hierarchies; use hyphens instead.
	Try to fit your newsgroup into an existing sub-hierarchy,
		if appropriate.
	Don't create a new sub-hierarchy unless it will have at
		least 2 groups in it.
	Above all, keep it short, but obvious. Don't exceed 14
		characters with any part of the name.

Examples:

	aus.ads.forsale

This is an example of a well-chosen name. It fits into a 
sub-hierarchy (aus.ads), and is specific.

	aus.personals

This is an example of a badly chosen newsgroup name. It has 
been placed outside the aus.ads.* sub-hierarchy.

	aus.dancing.morris

This is another badly chosen name. It creates a sub-hierarchy
(aus.dancing.*) for just one group. Usually, in cases like this,
the group is too specific, and you would be better starting
with a more general group (ie., aus.dancing), and splitting it
later, if the traffic on morris dancing becomes sufficient.

	aus.yachting-and-boarding

This name exceeds the 14 character limit in one section. The 14
character limit is set by some older computer systems, and is an
unfortunate anachronism, but one we have to live with.

People are going to argue about the name; this is because the
name is usually all that people have to go by. Even though
you're going to provide a one-line description of the group,
many sites won't include it in their newsgroups file, which
throws the full weight of defining the group onto a rather
cryptic jumble of letters. So take your time on this one.


2. Moderation and other stuff
   --------------------------

Some newsgroups are moderated. (See the postings in 
news.announce.newusers if you don't know what this means.) 
This has been unnecessary within the aus hierarchy in the 
past, but that shouldn't stop you from suggesting it, if you 
think it's appropriate.

Recently (as of late 1995), the practice of 'invading' newsgroups
has become something of a problem for many groups. This most
often takes the form of articles being crossposted to as many
different and inappropriate groups as possible. The consequences
of this can be severe - the crossposting magnifies the number of
followup articles, and most posters are not aware that they are
clogging unrelated newsgroups with their (usually inflammatory)
responses. You may wish to consider this in your proposal. You
may, for example, wish to limit crossposts to no more than some
small number of other groups, with due notice given that articles
that violate this may be cancelled.

In addition, some newsgroup 'splits' may not succeed because
people simply crosspost to both new and old groups. (At the time
of writing, aus.religion and aus.religion.christian are a good
example of this.) In these cases, you may wish to consider a
temporary (or permanent) embargo on crossposts between specific
groups.


3. Proposing the new group
   -----------------------

Propose the new group in the groups aus.general and 
aus.net.news. Ensure that your subject line includes the new 
group's name. Something like this will usually suffice:

	Subject: RFD: aus.foo

You should include the following information:

	1. The group name.
	2. A one-line description.
	3. A charter. See 'How to create a newsgroup' in
		news.answers.
	4. Whether or not it ought to be moderated.
	5. Whether or not crossposting is allowed.
	6. Any standard formats for Subject: lines.
	7. Any other rules that you think fit (eg., in
		some cases, followups may be forbidden).


4. Debating the proposal
   ---------------------

People will respond to your proposal in a variety of ways. 
Expect negative criticism. Some of it will come from people
who read like overbearing arseholes; some will come from
quite reasonable human beings. Try to be patient, and listen
to what they have to say. You may find that they are making 
sense. At this point, you might consider better group names 
(if suggested), moderation or not, changes to the 
newsgroup's charter, or maybe even whether or not the whole 
thing was a good idea in the first place. Try to be 
objective and mature about this, and don't take any of it 
personally (even if the overbearing arseholes get personal 
first).

Two things have to be taken into account at this point: one
is what you think, and the other is what other people think.
If you can't be dissuaded from a bad proposal by sound
arguments, fine. Go ahead and try to create the group. In
general, however, if few other people are convinced by
your arguments in favour of the newsgroup, it won't
propagate, and you'll end up wasting your time. (See point 6.)


5. Creating the new group
   ----------------------

This is best done by your news administrator. However, some news
administrators are 'control freaks' who may not permit the
creation to take place. (There are also news administrators who
don't know how to create newsgroups.) You will then have ask
someone else on the net to do it for you. (As a last resort, you
can ask me how it's done, but I really would rather that you
asked around in aus.net.news first.) Once created, the newsgroup
should appear slowly over the following week (some sites may take
up to a fortnight to get it; some may never get it at all, which
is just the way life is sometimes).

Once it's created, you probably ought to email me
(revdoc@uow.edu.au) with the following information:

	1. The one-line description of the group that you
	sent out in your control message; and
	
	2. A copy of the charter of the group.

The first item is used in the regular checkgroups messages that
are used to (try to) keep the aus.* hierarchy consistent
throughout its range. The charters are being archived, and as
soon as I decide what to do with them, will be made public in
some way.


6. What we do to people who don't follow the guidelines
   ----------------------------------------------------

There is no organisation that controls this sort of thing, 
so if you ignore these guidelines, or fail to be swayed by 
sound arguments in phase 4, the absolute worst that can happen
is that some annoyed folk may attempt to remove your group
immediately (see note 8); but the likeliest thing that will
happen is that your new group will not propagate. (You may
also get abusive e-mail and acquire a reputation as a dickhead.)
The least that will happen is that your group may propagate to
some extent, but will end up carrying zero traffic. Also, bear
in mind that many sites don't allow automatic newsgroup
creation - their news administrators filter newsgroup creation
manually, and only allow what they consider to be kosher
newsgroups to be created at their site. This means that
some groups won't be carried at some sites, no matter what.


7. Epilogue
   --------

Some newsgroups go on to greatness. Others languish in 
mediocrity. A few fade away. In the latter case, if your 
newsgroup ends up carrying zero traffic for months on end, 
you might consider removing it. Discuss this in aus.net.news 
first, however.


8. An Historical Note
   ------------------

A few years back, some folks got into a prolonged newgroup/rmgroup
war over a newsgroup called aus.bizarre. The result was a colossal
waste of time and money, largely due to a couple of people being
difficult. This episode shows just how immature some people can be
about new newsgroups. Consequently, I would suggest that all parties
interested in such things adopt the following as their mantra, to
be repeated over and over whenever anyone suggests a new newsgroup:

	"It isn't important, it's only zeroes and ones."
