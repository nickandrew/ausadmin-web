	Creating a new newsgroup in the aus.* hierarchy
	-----------------------------------------------

$Revision$
$Date$

This document describes a procedure for creating a new newsgroup
within the aus hierarchy. The organisation which oversees this
process has documented this and other information about aus.* in
the web site:

	http://aus.news-admin.org/

Procedures exist for creating new newsgroups in other 
hierarchies. The rules for creating new newsgroups in all 
other hierarchies except alt are particularly detailed, and 
can be found in regular postings in the newsgroup 
news.announce.newusers. You can also find much relevant information
in the USENET FAQ repository at:

0. Do you really need a new aus newsgroup ?
-------------------------------------------

Newsgroups exist primarily as a place for groups of people to discuss
things of importance to them. It is therefore important to consider
the topic of your newsgroup. Is it something which only a handful of
people may wish to discuss - in which case a mailing list may be a more
appropriate forum, more personal and has greater potential to keep the
subscribers involved.

Is your topic something which can only be discussed by certain people,
such as the members of an organisation? Again, a newsgroup may not
be appropriate in such a circumstance. Newsgroups are not generally
created to be mouthpieces for some organisation. There are lots of other
techniques available, like web chat rooms where access can be controlled
or discussions can be integrated with other facilities.

Is your topic related to some current affairs, e.g. the fall of the Berlin
Wall, or another Clinton Sex Scandal? A newsgroup on such a topic could be
considered to have a limited lifetime. It may flourish for a week or a
month but it can be expected to wither and die eventually. An example
of such is aus.flame.gareth-powell. It seemed a good idea at the time, in
1995 when Gareth got creamed by Stuart Littlemore on Media Watch, and there
was plenty of material with which to flame Gareth. Inevitably though, the
newsgroup withered and currently hosts only spam and random crosspostings.

Is there another newsgroup which covers your topic? You would need a good
reason to create a new place to discuss something where there's already a
place available. One appropriate reason may be volume of postings on your
subject; very active newsgroups may be split into subgroups - on the other
hand, if there's very little discussion going on in your topic, you may not
have a good reason to create a new group.

Finally, (since this is an aus.* FAQ) consider whether your topic is
uniquely Australian or has enough Australian content to justify a regional
newsgroup rather than a global one. For example, there's not much point
to having an Australian coca-cola newsgroup - you can buy coke around the
world and it's much the same wherever it is sold.

Ultimately the decision about creating a new newsgroup rests not with
yourself or with the aus.* hierarchy maintainer, but with your USENET
peers. When they discuss your group they will be applying much the same
guidelines as above, and you'll save yourself some effort and possible
embarrassment by thinking through the above criteria before proposing
a newsgroup in public.



1. Picking a name
   --------------

This really is amazingly important. A badly chosen name can 
arouse an astonishing amount of ire in other news users. A 
really bad name can cause software failures. To avoid 
annoying too many people, here are some suggestions:

	Try to be consistent with existing newsgroup names.
	Use nouns where possible.
	Always stick to letters and numbers.
	Letters must be lower case.
	Don't use dots as word separators, as they are used to 
		delimit sub-hierarchies; use hyphens instead.
	Try to fit your newsgroup into an existing sub-hierarchy,
		if appropriate.
	Don't create a new sub-hierarchy unless it can have at
		least 2 groups in it.
	Above all, keep it short, but obvious. Don't exceed 14
		characters with any part of the name.

Examples:

	aus.ads.forsale

This is an example of a well-chosen name. It fits into a 
sub-hierarchy (aus.ads), and is specific.

	aus.personals

This is an example of a badly chosen newsgroup name. It has 
been placed outside the aus.ads.* sub-hierarchy.

	aus.dancing.morris

This is another badly chosen name. It creates a sub-hierarchy
(aus.dancing.*) for just one group. Usually, in cases like this,
the group is too specific, and you would be better starting
with a more general group (ie., aus.dancing), and splitting it
later, if the traffic on morris dancing becomes sufficient.  Unless
there is a an overwhelming reason ausadmin will not create new
sub-hierarchies.

	aus.yachting-and-boarding

This name exceeds the 14 character limit in one section. The 14
character limit is set by some older computer systems, and is an
unfortunate anachronism, but one we have to live with.

[ We are looking to see if it is now safe to relax this rule on the
assumption that any 14 character limited system wouldn't be able to
handle todays traffic. -- David]

People are going to argue about the name; this is because the
name is usually all that people have to go by. Even though
you're going to provide a one-line description of the group,
many sites won't include it in their newsgroups file, which
throws the full weight of defining the group onto a rather
cryptic jumble of letters. So take your time on this one.

You can E-mail news@aus.news-admin.org at any time for advice
regarding choosing a name for your newsgroup. The aus.* news
hierarchy administrator's principal responsibility is ensuring
that newsgroup names are chosen wisely.

At this point you will also need to look into a description line.  The
description and the newsgroup name shouldn't be more then 80
characters long.


2. Moderation and other stuff
   --------------------------

Some newsgroups are moderated. (See the postings in news.announce.newusers
if you don't know what this means.)  This is rarely used within the aus
hierarchy but that shouldn't stop you from suggesting it, if you think
it's appropriate.

A moderated newsgroup can be a very useful resource. However it requires
the consistent attention of a moderator (who is usually you, as the
newsgroup proposer). As the moderator, the success or failure of your
newsgroup relies principally on your own shoulders.

Unlike fidonet and some other systems moderation works on an approval
system.  You are emailed each post to the newsgroup wich you reject or
approve after reading it.

3. Proposing the new group
   -----------------------

Write an RFD (Request for Discussion) and E-mail it to news@aus.news-admin.org

You can get a template for an RFD online at:
        http://aus.news-admin.org/Faq/RFD-template.txt

Ensure that your subject line includes the new group's name. Something
like this will usually suffice:

	Subject: RFD: aus.foo

You should include the following information:

       1.  The group name.
       2.  A one-line description.
       3.  A charter. See 'How to create a newsgroup' in news.answers.
       4.  An estimate of expected traffic for this group and the current
           traffic on the net related to this topic.
       5.  Whether or not it ought to be moderated.
       6.  Whether or not crossposting is allowed (e.g. crosspost limit).
       7.  Whether binary and/or HTML postings are allowed
(Note there is very strong opposition to binary newsgroups)
       8.  Cancellation policy for spam and other disallowed postings.
       9.  Any standard formats for Subject: lines.
       10. Any other rules that you think fit (eg., in some cases,
           followups may be forbidden).

The aus.* hierarchy administrator will review your proposal and either
accept or reject it.  It is most importent that you post your RFD to
news@aus.news-admin.org before you post it publicly, your RFD is
needed by ausadmin to generate the future CFV. If you've checked out
the newsgroup name with news@aus.news-admin.org in advance your
proposal will usually be accepted unless the administrator would like
to suggest some improvements in the format or content of the RFD.

Once your RFD is approved, post it to aus.net.news and aus.general for
public debate.

4. Debating the proposal
   ---------------------

People will respond to your proposal in a variety of ways. Expect
negative criticism. Some of it will come from people who read like
overbearing arseholes; some will come from quite reasonable human
beings.

The newsgroup name and the expected traffic are two of the most
importent things that are going to discussed at this point.  Ausadmin
and the people in aus.net.news are going to be looking for a everdence
that this newsgroup is going to get enought traffic to be a healthy
group.

Try to be patient, and listen to what they have to say. You
may find that they are making sense. At this point, you might consider
better group names (if suggested), moderation or not, changes to the
newsgroup's charter, or maybe even whether or not the whole thing was a
good idea in the first place. Try to be objective and mature about this,
and don't take any of it personally (even if the overbearing arseholes
get personal first).

Two things have to be taken into account at this point: one is what
you think, and the other is what other people think.  If you can't be
dissuaded from a bad proposal by sound arguments, fine. Go ahead and
take it to the next step. In general, however, if few other people
are convinced by your arguments in favour of the newsgroup, it won't
propagate, and you'll end up wasting your time. (See point 7.)


5. Voting for the group
-----------------------

[ This part is probably going to change a little -- nick@aus.news-admin.org ]

The next step is 21 days after the posting of the first RFD to write to 
ausadmin@aus.news-admin.org and ask them to send out a CFV.  

Voting in the aus.* hierarchy is done through E-mail, and votes are
tallied automatically so it is important for voters to follow the
instructions which will appear in the posted CFV.

A newsgroup request passes the vote if at least 2-thirds of the
respondents voted YES and there are at least 40 more YES votes than NO
votes. [Note: these parameters are experimental and may be adjusted
after some votes have been run -- nick@aus.news-admin.org ]

[Note: these parameters are still experimental but they have been
adjusted after some  votes where run -- dformosa@aus.news-admin.org]

It's requested that people refrean from discussing the newsgroup after
the CFV has been posted.  The newsgroup should have been discussed in
the RFD period.  Ausadmin may regard discussion in this period as a grose
abuse of the voting proccess.

When a vote completes the results of the vote are posted by Ausadmin
to aus.net.news. If there are no significant problems with the result
(e.g. no accusations of fraudulent voting) then Ausadmin issues the
appropriate control messages to request news administrators to create
the newsgroup.

If it fails you will not be able to propose it for anouther 3 months after
the close of votes, and anouther 6 months after the close of votes on a 
second failure.  


6. Creating the new group
   ----------------------

Creating a newsgroup successfully requires the newsgroup to be created
on a majority of news servers which participate in the aus.* hierarchy.
Ultimately it's the decision of the news administrator on each individual
news server whether or not to create a newsgroup; fortunately there are
some tools to help automate this process.

The primary method of requesting that a newsgroup be created or removed
is the "control message". In particular, "newgroup" and "rmgroup" are
used to request group creation and deletion, respectively.

Most USENET News software checks the sender address of incoming control
messages and the news administrator can decide whether to accept or
reject these messages based on the sender's address and other information.

Automation can only work if the news administrator trusts some party
to act responsibly. One such is David Lawrence (tale@uunet.net, now
group-admin@isc.org) who is the person generally trusted to perform
newsgroup addition and removal for the international newsgroups.

These days (i.e. 1998) many idiots post forged newgroup and rmgroup
control messages to USENET; this has resulted in the use of digital
certification technology by trusted parties to prove that they are
the issuers of requests. This is known as PGPverify and it is
used in the international newsgroup hierarchies (comp.*, rec.* etc.)
and in many regional hierarchies.

The Australian hierarchy has not used PGPverify until the handover of
the administrator responsibility to Nick Andrew <nick@zeta.org.au>,
rather, two addresses were commonly accepted as being trustworthy
issuers of requests: kre@munnari.oz.au and revdoc@uow.edu.au. These
two persons are no longer involved in newsgroup creation or deletion;
the responsibility is now (as of 1998-03-31) generally entrusted to
Nick Andrew <nick@zeta.org.au> who has set up an organisation at
aus.news-admin.org to oversee the process and group creation into the
future.

So, (to cut a long story short) once your newsgroup request passes the
vote you can instruct news@aus.news-admin.org to go ahead and issue
the newgroup request. Due to the considerations in the previous
paragraph your newsgroup may not be accepted by some of the news
administrators; in most cases this is due to ignorance of the new
administrator address; please inform them of the change and the
web site http://aus.news-admin.org/ and ask them to create the group
on their own system. news@aus.news-admin.org is happy to send out
"booster" newgroup requests on demand, on the theory that as more
admins come to trust that address, the newsgroup propagation will
improve.

7. What we do to people who don't follow the guidelines
   ----------------------------------------------------

If you ignore these guidelines, or fail to be swayed by 
sound arguments in phase 4, the absolute worst that can happen
is that some annoyed folk may attempt to remove your group
immediately (see note 9); but the likeliest thing that will
happen is that your new group will not propagate.

In the case of vote forgery or other abuses of the voting systems the
admin may reverse or disregard votes and/or results.

 (You may
also get abusive e-mail and acquire a reputation as a dickhead.)
The least that will happen is that your group may propagate to
some extent, but will end up carrying zero traffic. Also, bear
in mind that many sites don't allow automatic newsgroup
creation - their news administrators filter newsgroup creation
manually, and only allow what they consider to be kosher
newsgroups to be created at their site. This means that
some groups won't be carried at some sites, no matter what.



8. Epilogue
   --------

Some newsgroups go on to greatness. Others languish in mediocrity. A few
fade away. In the latter case, if your newsgroup ends up carrying zero
traffic for months on end, you might consider removing it. Discuss this
in aus.net.news first, however.


9. An Historical Note
   ------------------

A few years back, some folks got into a prolonged newgroup/rmgroup
war over a newsgroup called aus.bizarre. The result was a colossal
waste of time and money, largely due to a couple of people being
difficult. This episode shows just how immature some people can be
about new newsgroups. Consequently, I would suggest that all parties
interested in such things adopt the following as their mantra, to
be repeated over and over whenever anyone suggests a new newsgroup:

	"It isn't important, it's only zeroes and ones."
