The aus.arts.comics newsgroup exists to allow Australians interested in
reading and collecting comic books to share their appreciation of comic
books both old and new, including Australian comic books, to help
organise and publicise Australian conventions, fairs and tours and to
discuss matters of common concern, such as distribution and censorship.
