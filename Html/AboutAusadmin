<h2>About Ausadmin</h2>
<p>
ausadmin (short for "aus.* newsgroup administration") is a volunteer
effort to maintain and develop the aus.* USENET newsgroup hierarchy.
We will achieve this by setting a clear policy for the growth of
Australian newsgroups, managing the creation and deletion of
newsgroups according to this policy, and providing online information
to support the development of Australian newsgroups as a national
resource.
</p>

<p>The aus.* administrator is currently
Nick Andrew (<a href="http://www.nick-andrew.net">www.nick-andrew.net</a>),
and operational staff and facilities are provided by
<a href="http://www.tull.net/">Tullnet Pty Ltd</a>.
