<h2>About Ausadmin</h2>
<p>
ausadmin (short for "aus.* newsgroup administration") is a volunteer
effort to maintain and develop the aus.* USENET newsgroup hierarchy.
We will achieve this by setting a clear policy for the growth of
Australian newsgroups, managing the creation and deletion of
newsgroups according to this policy, and providing online information
to support the development of Australian newsgroups as a national
resource.
</p>

<p>The aus.* administrator is currently
Nick Andrew (<a href="http://www.nick-andrew.net">www.nick-andrew.net</a>),
and operational staff and facilities are provided by
<a href="http://www.tull.net/">Tullnet Pty Ltd</a>.
</p>

<h2>aus.* hierarchy policy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Newsgroup creation only (no newsgroup deletions yet)
<li>Unmoderated newsgroup creation only
<li>Proposals considered by ausadmin to be frivolous or intended to "work the system" will be rejected
<li>No change of newsgroups from unmoderated to moderated
<li>2-level newsgroups (aus.X) accepted only for major categories (e.g. science, arts, sport, humanities -- most of which exist already)
<li>3-level newsgroups (aus.X.Y) accepted only when parent exists (aus.X) or a sibling group already exists (aus.X.Z)
<li>The effect of the above two rules is that if you want a new group e.g. <i>aus.language.strine</i> with no existing parent and no siblings, then you need to first work on getting <i>aus.language</i> created, and that group will have to make do for strine discussions as well as other language discussions. You would then wait 1-2 years before proposing <i>aus.language.strine</i>.
<li>No change of charter yet, but if you wish to propose a charter for an existing group which does not already have a charter, email it in and ausadmin will consider accepting it directly as the new charter.
</ul>
