<h1>Newsgroup Creation Proposals</h1>
<p>
How to create a new newsgroup:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you really need a new newsgroup, and not a mailing list or a website or an existing newsgroup</li>
<li>Define the Topic and choose a group name which meets the ausadmin policy</li>
<li>Choose a short (less than 80 characters) one-line description for the newsgroup</li>
<li>Follow the {{A|Ausadmin/Proposal/Process|newsgroup proposal process}}</li>
</ol>

<p>
You will need this template:

<h2>Do you really need a new newsgroup?</h2>
<p>
Newsgroups exist so that the general public can discuss topics of
interest to themselves. There are many other technologies available
and they serve different needs. Your needs may be better served by
something other than a newsgroup.
</p>
<p>
Here's a quick comparison of the technologies, and when you would
want to use one over the other:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#d0ffd0" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
 <th>&nbsp;</th>
 <th>Mailing List</th>
 <th>Blog</th>
 <th>Webboard</th>
 <th>USENET Newsgroup</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>Contributions From</th>
 <td>Subscribers only</td>
 <td>One Person</td>
 <td>Subscribers only</td>
 <td>Anybody</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>Readership</th>
 <td>Subscribers only</td>
 <td>Random web surfers</td>
 <td>Random web surfers</td>
 <td>Anybody</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>Control over content</th>
 <td>total (if moderated)</td>
 <td>total</td>
 <td>Can delete comments</td>
 <td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>Dissemination</th>
 <td>Only to subscribers</td>
 <td>Nobody, until it becomes well-known</td>
 <td>Nobody, until it becomes well-known</td>
 <td>Very good in Australia, somewhat patchy overseas</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>HTML &amp; image support</th>
 <td>Limited (depends on subscribers)</td>
 <td>Full</td>
 <td>Very good</td>
 <td>No - text only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>Needs Community support</th>
 <td>No</td>
 <td>No</td>
 <td>No</td>
 <td>Yes</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Here's a checklist of items to consider before proposing a
new newsgroup:
<ul>
 <li>Does the group topic not overlap any other topics in aus.* ?</li>
 <li>Is the topic of interest to potentially anybody?</li>
 <li>Is the newsgroup intended for members of some organisation? (if so, forget it)</li>
 <li>Do you wish the newsgroup to promote some agenda? (if so, forget it; people will contribute all manner of diverse opinion)</li>
 <li>Will the topic be long-lasting?</li>
 <li>Is the topic uniquely Australian or will there be enough Australian posters to justify its creation?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Choosing a name for the new newsgroup</h2>
<p>
Choosing a good name is critical. If you choose a bad name your proposal
will be rejected by ausadmin or it won't pass a vote.
<ul>
<li>Try to be consistent with existing newsgroup names.</li>
<li>Use nouns where possible.</li>
<li>Always stick to letters and numbers.</li>
<li>Letters must be lower case.</li>
<li>Don't use dots as word separators, as they are used to delimit sub-hierarchies; use hyphens instead.</li>
<li>Try to fit your newsgroup into an existing sub-hierarchy, if appropriate.</li>
<li>Don't create a new sub-hierarchy unless it can have at least 2 groups in it.</li>
<li>Above all, keep it short, but obvious. Try to keep all newsgroup name components under 15 characters in length.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<table>
<tr>
 <th colspan="2">Example newsgroup names</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>aus.ads.forsale.real-estate</td>
 <td>Good. It fits into an existing sub-hierarchy (aus.ads.forsale) and uses a hyphen to separate words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>aus.ads.forsale.houses</td>
 <td>Bad. What if somebody wants to sell an apartment? You can't expect everybody to read the newsgroup's Charter before posting into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>aus.dancing.morris</td>
 <td>Bad. This would create a new sub-hierarchy (aus.dancing) for just one group, leaving no place to discuss other forms of dance. You would be better off proposing a more general group (i.e. aus.dancing).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Unless there is a a compelling reason to do otherwise, ausadmin
will refuse to accept proposals for names like aus.dancing.morris
where aus.dancing does not already exist and there are no existing
groups named aus.dancing.something. In other words, ausadmin prefers
more general groups to be created first, and when need arises these
general groups can be subdivided into more specific groups.
