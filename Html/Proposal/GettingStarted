<h1>Newsgroup Creation Proposals</h1>
<p>
How to create a new newsgroup:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you really need a new newsgroup, and not a mailing list or a website or an existing newsgroup</li>
<li>Define the Topic and choose a group name which meets the ausadmin policy</li>
<li>Follow the {{A|Proposal/Process|newsgroup proposal process}}</li>
</ol>

<p>
You will need this template:

<h2>Do you really need a new newsgroup?</h2>
<p>
Newsgroups exist so that the general public can discuss topics of
interest to themselves. There are many other technologies available
and they serve different needs. Your needs may be better served by
something other than a newsgroup.
</p>
<p>
Here's a quick comparison of the technologies, and when you would
want to use one over the other:

<p>
Here's a checklist of items to consider before proposing a
new newsgroup:
<ul>
 <li>Does the group topic not overlap any other topics in aus.* ?</li>
 <li>Is the topic of interest to potentially anybody?</li>
 <li>Is the newsgroup intended for members of some organisation? (if so, forget it)</li>
 <li>Do you wish the newsgroup to promote some agenda? (if so, forget it; people will contribute all manner of diverse opinion)</li>
 <li>Will the topic be long-lasting?</li>
 <li>Is the topic uniquely Australian or will there be enough Australian posters to justify its creation?</li>
</ul>
</p>
