  <title>Newsgroup Creation Process - Step 0 - Is a new newsgroup needed?</title>
</head>

<h1>Do you really need a new aus newsgroup?</h1>
<p>
Newsgroups exist primarily as a place for groups of people to discuss
things of importance to them. It is therefore important to consider
the topic of the newsgroup. Is it something which only a handful of
people may wish to discuss - in which case a mailing list may be a more
appropriate forum, more personal and has greater potential to keep the
subscribers involved.
</p>

<p>
Is your topic something which can only be discussed by certain people,
such as the members of an organisation? Again, a newsgroup may not
be appropriate in such a circumstance. Newsgroups are not generally
created to be mouthpieces for some organisation. There are lots of other
techniques available, like web chat rooms where access can be controlled
or discussions can be integrated with other facilities.
</p>

<p>
Newsgroups are also not intended to be used only by people who hold
some particular opinion. In other words, the topic of the newsgroup
is all-important, and not the likely audience.
</p>

<p>
Is your topic related to some current affairs?
A newsgroup on such a topic could be
considered to have a limited lifetime. It may flourish for a week or a
month but it can be expected to wither and die eventually. Once a newsgroup
has been created, it is hard (or maybe impossible) to remove. It is therefore
a really good idea to avoid creating newsgroups to discuss specific current
affairs.
</p>

<p>
Is there another newsgroup which covers your topic? You would need a good
reason to create a new place to discuss something where there's already a
place available. One appropriate reason may be volume of postings on your
subject; very active newsgroups may be split into subgroups - on the other
hand, if there's very little discussion going on in your topic, you may not
have a good reason to create a new group.
</p>

<p>
Finally, consider whether your topic is
uniquely Australian or has enough Australian content to justify a regional
newsgroup rather than a global one. For example, there's not much point
to having an Australian coca-cola newsgroup - you can buy coke around the
world and it's much the same wherever it is sold.
