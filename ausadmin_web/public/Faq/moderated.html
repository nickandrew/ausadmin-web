<h1>Question: How to change an existing aus newsgroup to moderated?</h1>
<p>
Answer:
<p>
A group can be changed to moderated if you submit a proposal (i.e. an RFD)
with appropriate justification. After discussion takes place, if you wish
to take it to a vote, a CFV will be issued just like for a new newsgroup.
<p>
If the vote passes (the usual criteria), then ausadmin will issue a control
message which will change the group status to "m" for moderated.
<p>
Of course you will have to choose a moderator for the group.
<p>
The moderator should be somebody with plenty of time, who is reliable,
quite familiar with USENET, and with flexible posting software so they
will be able to repost approved submissions as the original sender
without hassle.
<p>
Of course they should be interested in the newsgroup, and be able to
act impartially (i.e. approve or reject submissions based on their
relevance to the newsgroup, not on whether they agree with the
moderator's own beliefs).
